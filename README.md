# UE4DedicatedServer
Simple dedicated server implementation based on the Third Person C++ example included with Unreal Engine 4

## Instructions

This was originally taken from the great guide on how to set this up on the unreal official wiki

https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Dedicated_Server_Guide_(Windows_%26_Linux)

## Notes

If the instructions don't work, go back and re-do them from the beginning. There are a lot of subtle little things that need to be correct for this to fall into place.
